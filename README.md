### Hi, I'm Kenya. I'm a Project Officer working at the University of Technology Sydney. 

I create and update process maps which are used to identify areas for improvement.

I am also the principal developer on the Robotic Process Automation project, with the goal of identifying and automating manual processes to improve the student experience by reducing turn around times.
