### Hi, I'm Kenya. I'm a Project Officer working at the University of Technology Sydney. 

I work on projects within the Lifetime Learner Experience Unit (formerly Student Administration Unit) with a goal of streamlining and improving processes to improve the a Learner's experience.

I am also the principal developer on the Robotic Process Automation project which automates processes within the LLE Unit.

I am currently building my [portfolio page](https://kenyachan.dev), and a [magic eightball site](https://magic8ball.kenyachan.dev/).
